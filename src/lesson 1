Cultural humility is not a one-off course about “other cultures”. It is a lifelong professional stance built on three interlocking commitments:









⦿ ongoing critical self-reflection and learning about yourself and your context;



⦿ active attention to power imbalances in relationships and systems; and



⦿ institutional accountability for fair and equitable outcomes.

Learning outcomes for Lesson 1. By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:







⦿ define cultural humility in your own words, aligned to your role or discipline;



⦿ differentiate humility from cultural “sensitivity” and “competence”; and



⦿ identify at least two observable behaviours that demonstrate humility in practice.



//CardEnd





Humility versus “competence”

“Cultural competence” is often described as a set of skills or knowledge you can acquire. While skills and knowledge are important, competence alone can create a sense that you can “master” other people’s cultures and that once you have completed a course, the work is done.

Cultural humility takes a different starting point. It assumes that you will never fully know someone else’s experiences. Instead, you commit to staying curious, reflective and open to being changed by what you learn from people and communities over time.
